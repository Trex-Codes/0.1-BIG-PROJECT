					Hello!. I'm from Colombia I have fifteen years, I live in Bogota, I am a very dedicated person to what I like, my biggest dream is to debut as a professional football player, as in Equity FC or to play in National FC. I like one of the most unpleasant positions of football, the goalkeeper. Although is not easy, neither is it impossible.</p>
